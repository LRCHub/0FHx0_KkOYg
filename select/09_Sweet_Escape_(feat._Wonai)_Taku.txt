Every time I picture world
I want you girl right in it
Invested, you're my business
Damn, I must admit you can get it
No-one compares to you I mean
You're the girl I've been seeing in my dreams
Though my boys are gonna say I'm kind of whipped
Truth is I think I kind of am
You in the country opposite Japan
I want to be there girl to hold your hand
Let you know that you're my future plan
Nod your head cause I know I understand
You, with a face like that
How could any man ever true to say no to you
Uh, with a smile like that
Can't believe it took me this long to notice you
Uh, you my babygirl
Our love is gonna make them jealous
Mirror Mirror, girl you the ferris
Heads turning just like a ferris
Uh, uh, and you parlay
Love it I used to speak Francais
I'm just saying, no thank you God
Wear a helmet if you're down to ride
Uh, uh, if you're down to ride
Threaten me, you make me feel alive
Uh, uh, you make me feel alive
Like a gift girl you do suprise
Uh, uh, you my babygirl
Uh, uh, you my babygirl
Uh, uh, and that's never changing
And all you gotta do is pick a place and then we going (going)
We won't say a word 'cause we don't want nobody knowing (knowing)
'Cause it's our sweet escape (uh)
Into our happy place (uh)
Come on let's hit the road
But first let me kiss your face
Shawty oh, (yeah)
Come ride with me (uh)
Shawty oh, (yeah)
Have fun with me (uh)
Shawty oh, (It's a sweet escape)
Be my girl forever (It's a sweet escape)
And ever (It's a sweet escape)
Come with me, you better say goodbye
Let 'em know you my ride or die
Pick a place girl, anywhere
Even if we starting off in Dubai
Forever, fluorescent
I'm digging your presence
Adventurous, we are
We always jet setting
Uh, uh never looking out
'Cause I know that you my world and my star
Never knew why I was looking, looking too far
Me and you, what were the odds
'Cause I fucked around with a couple people
None of them close to what not your equal
Ended all that when I got the chance
Girl I never thought that you'd be my sequel, oh
Girl, if you want
I could book a flight and we could fly away
Drinking chardonnay
All we need now is Marvin Gaye
Uh, girl a word from Hera
Me and you are gonna last forever
Bish you knew you a fucking baller
You deserve a brand new Impala
Uh, you my baby girl
Uh, you my baby girl
Uh, we gon' change the world
Uh, we gon' change the world
Uh, let's make 'em jealous
Uh, make 'em jealous
Make 'em jealous, girl
And all you gotta do is pick a place and then we going (going)
We won't say a word 'cause we don't want nobody knowing (knowing)
'Cause it's our sweet escape (uh)
Into our happy place
Come on let's hit the road
But first let me kiss your face
Shawty oh
Come ride with me
Shawty oh
Have fun with me
Shawty oh, (It's a sweet escape)
Be my girl forever (It's a sweet escape)
And ever (It's a sweet escape)
