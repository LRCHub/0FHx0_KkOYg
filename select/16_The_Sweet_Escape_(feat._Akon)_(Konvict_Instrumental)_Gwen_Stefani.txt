Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo

If I could escape
I would but, first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank
And treating you this way

'Cause I've been acting like
Sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason
I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever)
Perfectly together

And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

(Sweet escape)
I wanna get away (wanna get away)
To our sweet escape
I want to get away
Yeah

You melt me down
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground

So baby
Times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever)
Perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?

(Sweet escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
If I could escape
Woo hoo, yee hoo
If I could escape
Woo hoo, yee hoo

'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever)
Perfectly together

And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)

We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(I wanna get away, get away)
Woo hoo, yee hoo

(To our sweet escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(I wanna get away)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
(Yeah)

Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
